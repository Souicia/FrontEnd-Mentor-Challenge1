-----------Read Me for Product Review Card Component Challenge---------------

This challenge is from https://www.frontendmentor.io/home, a cool website with plenty of challenges for FrontEnd Developers
(which I am not... yet...).

The goal of this challenge is to reproduce the original page, found in the design folder, and try to code it as close to
the original as possible. 

The index.html is my attempt to this challenge. I think it looks close enough, though if somebody on this planet could
tell me how the to change the font-size (or font-family) of a text when you hover over a button when this text is above 
the button, I would be very sincerely thankful. (If you don't know what I am talking about, compare the picture active-states.jpg
and desktop-design.jpg in the design folder, and look at the description).

Any other feedback or points of improvements is very, very welcome.

Thanks for passing by :)!
